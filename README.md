We have cloned a restaurant table reservation application called DineOut. It simply meant allowing diners to reserve a guaranteed table at the top restaurants in the city. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform for all dining out needs.

In this Project, We have tried to implement some of the functionalities of the application like filtering the restaurants based on cuisine, offers, and the facilities available with them along with these we have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a table and applying best available offers at a restaurant.
